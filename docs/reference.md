## Command Line Usage

<!-- `$ bash ./src/nixos-anywhere.sh --help` -->

```
Usage: nixos-anywhere [options] <ssh-host>

Options:

* -f, --flake <flake_uri>
  set the flake to install the system from.
* -i <identity_file>
  selects which SSH private key file to use.
* -p, --ssh-port <ssh_port>
  set the ssh port to connect with
* --ssh-option <ssh_option>
  set an ssh option
* -L, --print-build-logs
  print full build logs
* -s, --store-paths <disko-script> <nixos-system>
  set the store paths to the disko-script and nixos-system directly
  if this is give, flake is not needed
* --no-reboot
  do not reboot after installation, allowing further customization of the target installation.
* --kexec <path>
  use another kexec tarball to bootstrap NixOS
* --post-kexec-ssh-port <ssh_port>
  after kexec is executed, use a custom ssh port to connect. Defaults to 22
* --copy-host-keys
  copy over existing /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* host keys to the installation
* --stop-after-disko
  exit after disko formatting, you can then proceed to install manually or some other way
* --extra-files <file...>
  files to copy into the new nixos installation
* --disk-encryption-keys <remote_path> <local_path>
  copy the contents of the file or pipe in local_path to remote_path in the installer environment,
  after kexec but before installation. Can be repeated.
* --no-substitute-on-destination
  disable passing --substitute-on-destination to nix-copy
* --debug
  enable debug output
* --option <key> <value>
  nix option to pass to every nix related command
* --from <store-uri>
  URL of the source Nix store to copy the nixos and disko closure from
* --build-on-remote
  build the closure on the remote machine instead of locally and copy-closuring it
* --vm-test
  build the system and test the disk configuration inside a VM without installing it to the target.

## Explanation of known error messages

TODO: Add additional error messages and meanings. Fill in missing explanations

This section lists known error messages and their explanations. Some
explanations may refer to the following CLI syntax:

`nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- --flake <path to configuration>#<configuration name> root@<ip address>`

This list is not comprehensive. It's possible you may encounter errors that
originate from the underlying operating system. These should be documented in
the relevant operating system manual.
