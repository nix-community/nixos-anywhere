  the environment variable SSHPASS. Additionally, sudo password can be set
  via SUDO_PASSWORD environment variable for remote sudo operations
  (only supported with sudo, not doas)
* -s, --store-paths <disko-script> <nixos-system>
  set the store paths to the disko-script and nixos-system directly
  if this is given, flake is not needed
* --no-reboot
  do not reboot after installation, allowing further customization of the target installation.
* --kexec <path>
  use another kexec tarball to bootstrap NixOS
* --kexec-extra-flags
  extra flags to add into the call to kexec, e.g. "--no-sync"
* --ssh-store-setting <key> <value>
  ssh store settings appended to the store URI, e.g. "compress true". <value> needs to be URI encoded.
* --post-kexec-ssh-port <ssh_port>

* --copy-host-keys
  copy over existing /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* host keys to the installation
* --stop-after-disko
  exit after disko formatting, you can then proceed to install manually or some other way
* --extra-files <path>
  contents of local <path> are recursively copied to the root (/) of the new NixOS installation. Existing files are overwritten
  Copied files will be owned by root. See documentation for details.
* --disk-encryption-keys <remote_path> <local_path>
  copy the contents of the file or pipe in local_path to remote_path in the installer environment,

* --vm-test
  build the system and test the disk configuration inside a VM without installing it to the target.
* --build-on auto|remote|local
  sets the build on settings to auto, remote or local. Default is auto.
  auto: tries to figure out, if the build is possible on the local host, if not falls back gracefully to remote build
  local: will build on the local host
  remote: will build on the remote host
