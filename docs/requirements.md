## Requirements

### Source Machine

1. **Supported Systems:**
   - Linux or macOS computers with Nix installed.
   - NixOS
   - Windows systems using WSL2.

   _Note_: Should be able to build nix derivations for the target platform.
   Otherwise `--build-on-remote` can be used.

2. **Nix Installation:** If Nix is not yet installed on your system, refer to
   the [nix installation page](https://nixos.org/download#download-nix).

### Destination Machine

The machine must be reachable over the public internet or local network.
Nixos-anywhere does not support wifi networks. If a VPN is needed, define a
custom installer via the --kexec flag which connects to your VPN.

1. **Direct Boot Option:**
   - Must be already running a NixOS installer.

2. **Alternative Boot Options:** If not booting directly from a NixOS installer
   image:
   - **Architecture & Support:** Must be operating on:
     - x86-64 or aarch64 Linux systems with kexec support. Note: While most
       x86-64 Linux systems support kexec, if you're using an architecture other
       than those mentioned, you may need to specify a
       [different kexec image](./howtos/INDEX.md#using-your-own-kexec-image)
       manually.
   - **Memory Requirements:**
     - At least 1 GB of RAM (excluding swap space).
