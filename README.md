# nixos-anywhere

***Install NixOS everywhere via ssh***

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numtide/nixos-anywhere/main/docs/logo.png)

Setting up a new machine is time-consuming, and becomes complicated when it needs to be done remotely. If you're installing NixOS, the **nixos-anywhere** (formerly known as **nixos-remote**) tool allows you to pre-configure the whole process including:

- Disk partitioning and formatting
- Configuring and installing either NixOS or SrvOS
- Installing additional files and software

You can then initiate an unattended installation with a single CLI command. Since **nixos-anywhere** can access the new machine using SSH, it's ideal for remote installations.

Once you have initiated the command, there is no need to 'babysit' the installation. It all happens automatically.

You can use the stored configuration to repeat the same installation if you need to.

## Overview

If you have machines on a mix of platforms, you'll need a common installation solution that works anywhere. **nixos-anywhere** is ideal in this situation.

**nixos-anywhere** can be used equally well for cloud servers, bare metal servers such as Hetzner, and local servers accessible via a LAN. You can create standard configurations, and use the same configuration to create identical servers anywhere.

You first create Nix configurations to specify partitioning, formatting and NixOS configurations. Further options can be controlled by a flake and by run-time switches.

Once the configuration has been created, a single command will:

- Connect to the remote server via SSH
- Detect whether a NixOS installer is present; if not, it will use the Linux ```kexec``` tool to boot into a Nixos installer.
- Use the [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) tool to partition and format the hard drive
- Install NixOS
- Optionally install any Nix packages and other software required.
- Optionally copy additional files to the new machine

It's also possible to use **nixos-anywhere** to simplify the installation on a machine that has no current operating system, first booting from a NixOS installer image. This feature is described in the [how-to guide](./docs/how_to.md#installing-on-a-machine-with-no-operating-system). It's useful because you can pre-configure your required software and preferences, and build the new machine with a single command.

**Important Note:** Never use a production server as the target. It will be completely overwritten and all data lost. This tool should only be used for commissioning a new computer or repurposing an old machine once all important data has been migrated.

## Prerequisites

- Source Machine:
  
- - Can be any Linux machine with Nix installed, or a NixOS machine.
- Target Machine:
  
  - Unless you're using the option to boot from a NixOS installer image, or providing your own ```kexec``` image, it must be running x86-64 Linux with kexec support. Most x86_64 Linux systems do have kexec support. By providing your own [image](./docs/how_to.md#using-your-own-kexec-image) you can also perform kexec for other architectures eg aarch64
    
  - Must have at least 1.5 GB of RAM, excluding swap.
    

## How to use nixos-anywhere

Here’s  a quick summary of how to use **nixos-anywhere**. You can find more information in the [product documentation](./docs).

The tool doesn't need to be installed, since it can be run directly from this repository.

First create a repo that includes the disk configuration and a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to configure your options. This example assumes that flakes have been enabled on your source machine. 

Here’s an example of a simple disk configuration:

```
{ disks ? [ "/dev/vda" ], ... }:
{
  disk = {
    main = {
      type = "disk";
      device = builtins.elemAt disks 0;
      content = {
        type = "table";
        format = "gpt";
        partitions = [
          {
            name = "boot";
            type = "partition";
            start = "0";
            end = "1M";
            flags = [ "bios_grub" ];
          }
          {
            type = "partition";
            name = "ESP";
            start = "1M";
            end = "512M";
            bootable = true;
            content = {
              type = "filesystem";
              format = "vfat";
              mountpoint = "/boot";
            };
          }
          {
            type = "partition";
            name = "root";
            start = "512M";
            end = "100%";
            content = {
              type = "filesystem";
              format = "ext4";
              mountpoint = "/";
            };
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

The [disko repository](https://github.com/nix-community/disko/tree/master/example) has several examples of disk configurations. You can adapt them to our own needs.

A simple flake may look like this:

```
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = github:NixOS/nixpkgs;
  inputs.disko.url = github:nix-community/disko;
  inputs.disko.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, disko, ... }@attrs: {
  #-----------------------------------------------------------
  #The following line names the configuration as hetzner-cloud
  #This name will be referenced when nixos-remote is run
  #-----------------------------------------------------------
    nixosConfigurations.hetzner-cloud = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      specialArgs = attrs;
      modules = [
        ({modulesPath, ... }: {
          imports = [
            (modulesPath + "/installer/scan/not-detected.nix")
            (modulesPath + "/profiles/qemu-guest.nix")
            disko.nixosModules.disko
          ];
          disko.devices = import ./disk-config.nix {
            lib = nixpkgs.lib;
          };
          boot.loader.grub = {
            devices = [ "/dev/sda" ];
            efiSupport = true;
            efiInstallAsRemovable = true;
          };
          services.openssh.enable = true;
#-------------------------------------------------------
# Change the line below replacing <insert your key here>
# with your own ssh public key
#-------------------------------------------------------
          users.users.root.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [ "<insert your key here>" ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Once you’ve created the disk configuration and the flake, you can run the tool with a single nix command, which may look like this:

```
nix run github:numtide/nixos-anywhere -- --flake github:JillThornhill/flakes-example#hetzner-cloud root@135.181.254.201
```

Note that this command references the URL of your flake, in this case github:JillThornhill/flakes-example, together with the name of the system #hetzner-cloud, as highlighted by the comment in the sample flake.

The [Quickstart Guide](./docs/Quickstart.md) gives more information on how to run **nixos-anywhere** in its simplest form. For more specific instructions to suit individual requirements, see the [How To Guide](./docs/how_to.md).
